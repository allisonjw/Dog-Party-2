**Description of The Project** 

This was my first project of Module 1 at Turing School of School of Software and Design. The goal was to build two 1-page static site's from a comp that was provided. We were challenged to use one html.index file and two style sheets. There is also some interaction with JavaScript and the DOM. The site is about three dogs. The following were used:

- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript/DOM
- Chrome DevTools
- Terminal
- GIT/Github

Here is the static site for Comp 1:
